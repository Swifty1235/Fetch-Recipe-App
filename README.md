### Summary: Include screen shots or a video of your app highlighting its features
For this project, I prioritized creating a user-friendly UI. I believe that even if the functionality is flawless, a complex or unresponsive UI can ruin the user experience. My focus was on designing an intuitive and visually appealing interface that enhances the user’s interaction with the app.
### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
I spent approximately 10 hours on this project over the course of 3 days. Most of my time was allocated to refining the UI and ensuring the app met the project requirements, with additional time spent troubleshooting and implementing image caching.
### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
I didn’t feel like I made any significant trade-offs, as the information is presented as needed, and the core functionality works as intended. However, I acknowledge that the UI could have been cleaner in certain areas. Balancing between getting a functional product out and endlessly refining the UI was a decision I had to make during the process.
### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
The weakest part of the project, in my opinion, is the UI. While it is functional and meets the requirements, I wasn’t completely satisfied with its design and feel. I could have spent more time refining it, but I also wanted to ensure the project was completed within a reasonable timeframe. Another challenge was implementing image caching, as I hadn’t worked with it before. It required considerable time researching and experimenting with solutions, but I’m glad I was able to make it work in the end.
### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
This project came during a busy time for me, as I was finishing my final semester and managing the holiday season. I appreciate the flexibility of not having a strict deadline, which allowed me to complete it thoroughly. While I recognize there are many areas where I can improve and topics I still need to learn, I’m eager to dedicate the time and effort necessary to grow and develop these skills.
